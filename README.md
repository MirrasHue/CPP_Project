# CPP_Project

Developed with Unreal Engine 4  

Note that if you download the zip file, the Content folder will not be downloaded properly since it is set apart in Git LFS. So, for the project to behave correctly right out of the box, you will need to clone the repo.  

Skeletal mesh and animations from Mixamo.
